Assignment B2 README

Kyle Clark, Nathan Del Carmen, Nick Pleeter, Eric Song

In this project we construct an environment and behaviors for 3 participants. The affordances
that we implemented include waving at one another, picking up a ball, and wandering between set
waypoints. The user can interaction with the scene by left-clicking on the brown box in the
center of the scene and moving it around with the arrow keys, this affects the pathing of the
characters to their waypoints.

The next step was to implement throwing the ball between the characters but we were unable to
figure out how to use Inverse Kinematics and KADAPT to do this.

Included in this .zip file is the offline build as well as the the required Assets and Scripts.
We chose to just edit the scene that was originally included in the KADAPT files, thus all of the
KADAPT files are included.
